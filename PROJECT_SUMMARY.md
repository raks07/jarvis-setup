# Project Progress Summary

## Overview

I have set up a comprehensive foundation for our Document Management and RAG-based Q&A Application. The application consists of three main components across four GitHub repositories, each with a well-defined structure and core functionality implemented.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Project Setup

- Created a structured project organization with separate directories for each component
- Established Docker and Docker Compose infrastructure for local development and deployment
- Created comprehensive documentation including README files and development guide

### 2. jarvis-datastore (RAG and Document Ingestion)

- Set up FastAPI application structure with proper separation of concerns
- Implemented database models for documents, chunks, embeddings, and Q&A
- Created schemas for API requests and responses
- Implemented service layer architecture for business logic
- Provided basic implementations for embedding generation, document ingestion, and RAG-based Q&A

### 3. jarvis-backend (User and Document Management)

- Set up NestJS application structure following best practices
- Implemented entity models and DTOs for users, documents, and ingestion
- Created authentication system with JWT and role-based authorization
- Implemented controllers and services for user, document, and ingestion management
- Added integration with jarvis-datastore for document ingestion

### 4. jarvis-frontend

- Created modern UI using React and Material-UI
- Implemented state management with Redux Toolkit
- Developed components for user interface including:
  - Authentication (login/register)
  - Document management and upload
  - Ingestion management
  - RAG-based Q&A interface
  - User management for administrators
- Added routing with protected routes based on user roles
- Implemented services for API communication

## Step 2

### jarvis-datastore Completion

1. Add database migrations using Alembic
2. Implement actual embedding generation with a language model
3. Develop proper chunking and text processing
4. Enhance RAG retrieval with proper vector search
5. Optimize performance for large document collections

### jarvis-backend Completion

1. Add database migrations using TypeORM
2. Implement file upload handling with proper validation
3. Complete integration with jarvis-datastore
4. Add proper error handling and validation
5. Implement monitoring and logging
6. Add unit and integration tests

### jarvis-frontend Completion

1. Implement real API integration replacing mock data
2. Add form validation and error handling
3. Enhance UI with responsive design for mobile devices
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Implement dark/light theme toggle
6. Add accessibility features
7. Optimize performance with code splitting and lazy loading

## Step 3

### User Management

1. Implement user roles and permissions
2. Add user profile management
3. Implement password reset and email verification

## Step 4

### Document Management

1. Implement document versioning
2. Add document sharing and collaboration features
3. Upload and download documents with progress indicators

## Step 5

### Unit and Integration Testing

1. Write unit tests for all components in the React FrontEnd code
2. Write integration tests for key user flows

### DevOps & Deployment (Not in the Scope)

1. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
2. Configure production-ready Docker images
3. Create Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment
4. Implement monitoring and logging infrastructure
5. Add backup and restore procedures for databases
